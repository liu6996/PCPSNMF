**Please refer to our following paper for algorithm details:**

Wenhui Wu, Yuheng Jia, Sam Kwong, and Junhui Hou, "Pairwise Constraint Propagation-Induced Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization," IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 2018.

**Usage**
 
* Run'mainPIE' to strat the demo for clustering.

* The demo codes need 'slnngraph' function of 'sltoolbox_r101' toolbox to construct nearest neighbor graph, which can also be replaced by the function downloading from https://github.com/ZJULearning/MatlabFunc/blob/master/Tools/EuDist2.m
